    ~~ Tic Tac Toe Game ~~

    Project Overview:
    This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other by taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

    Key Features:
    1. HTML Structure: The game board is constructed using basic HTML elements. A 3x3 grid is represented by a series of `div` elements, each styled as a game box. A button is included to start a new game.

    2. CSS Styling: The visual appearance of the game board is managed using CSS. This includes the layout of the grid, styling of the boxes, and responsive design to ensure the game looks good on different devices. CSS also handles the styling of the game information and the "New Game" button.

    3. JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript is used to handle the game's logic and interactions. It manages player turns, updates the game state, checks for win conditions, and determines if the game is a draw. The script also handles the functionality of the "New Game" button to reset the board.

    How It Works:
    - The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players can click on boxes to place their marks.
    - JavaScript keeps track of the current player, updates the grid accordingly, and checks for a win or draw after each move.
    - The "New Game" button resets the game board and starts a new game.

    Technologies Used:
    - HTML: Defines the structure of the game board and controls.
    - CSS: Styles the game board, making it visually appealing and responsive.
    - JavaScript: Manages the game logic, player interactions, and game state.

    Notes:
    - Ensure that the game logic correctly handles all win conditions and provides appropriate feedback to the players.
    - The design and styling can be adjusted to enhance user experience and visual appeal.
